# Elden Ring Random Wiki Page Viewer

This is an Android application that, when installed on your phone, will take you to random pages on an Elden Ring wiki (referred to by the user as "Nightreing" wiki).

## How to Get the App

1.  **Go to Releases:** Navigate to the [Releases section](https://github.com/aswitcher324/Aleatory-Elden-ring-nightreing/releases) of this GitHub repository.
2.  **Download the APK:** Find the latest release and download the `app-debug.apk` file.

## How to Install on Android

1.  **Download the APK:** Download the `app-debug.apk` file to your Android phone (you can do this directly from the Releases page in your phone's browser).
2.  **Allow "Install from unknown sources":**
    *   Android phones, for security reasons, typically block installations from outside the Google Play Store by default.
    *   To install an APK directly, you'll need to allow installations from "unknown sources" or grant permission to your browser/file manager to install apps.
    *   The exact steps can vary slightly depending on your Android version and phone manufacturer:
        *   Usually, you can go to **Settings > Security** or **Settings > Apps > Special app access > Install unknown apps**.
        *   Alternatively, when you try to open the APK file for the first time, your phone might prompt you to allow the installation from that specific source (e.g., your browser or file manager app).
3.  **Install the App:** Once permissions are set, tap on the downloaded `app-debug.apk` file to begin the installation. Follow the on-screen prompts.
